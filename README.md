# Machine-learning-approach-for-liver-disease-classification-and-prediction
Project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts liver disease based on patient data and to build a user-friendly web application for easy diagnosis. The model uses attributes like age, BMI, and liver function tests, with the CatBoost model selected for prediction accuracy. The web application, created using HTML, CSS, and Flask, takes user input and predicts the likelihood of liver disease.

#Features:
1. User-friendly interface to input relevent information.
2. Provides instant prediction results for liver disease likelihood after data submission.
3. Uses Flask to handle the logic and connection between the front-end and the machine learning model.
4. Responsive design for optimal user experience across devices.

#Technologies Used
1. Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib)
2. Machine learning
3. Flask(A Python web framework used for building the backend of the application)
4. HTML/CSS/JavaScript(for the fronted)
